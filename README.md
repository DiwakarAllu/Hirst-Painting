## Description of Spot Paintings:

Damien Hirst's Spot Paintings consist of perfectly rounded, glossy spots painted in various bright colors. These spots are neatly organized in grids on canvases of different sizes and shapes. Each painting adheres to specific rules: no repeated colors on the same canvas, every spot should be the same size as each other, and they are arranged in a constant grid. Some paintings have small spots that resemble candy dots, while larger ones may remind viewers of game boards like Twister.

## Technique:

Hirst's earliest Spot Paintings, created in 1986, featured spots placed next to each other, creating colorful patterns. He enjoyed this technique and produced around 90 spot paintings using it. Each spot is hand-painted, has the same color as the next spot, and is acrylic colored. Hirst found joy in creating this structured, colorful art.
